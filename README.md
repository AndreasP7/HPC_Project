# Phone UI for Ederly People

This project was developed according to the guidelines of the course: Human-Computer Interaction, AUEB 2024. The project aims to create a contemporary mobile User Interface that can be used by elderly people, that are not so much familiar with the use of a smartphone. The spiral model was deployed for the structure of the project. It included 3 phases, with each phase having at least two evalution methods such as questionnaires and interviews.

The User Interface is designed in a simple and modern manner in order to appeal and be convinient towards a person of third age. It showcases functionalities such as phone calls, SOS calls, personal data reminder, home GPS tracker and many more. Each one has a small amount of ramifications with the purpose of avoiding confusion from the user. The transition between them is straightforward and can be done rapidly. The design was made to serve that specific group age, consequently it has a relatively large size for most fonts and tappable areas are well seperated so as to avoid unwanted taps. The design was built up with the use of Figma while the final product was developed via Android Studio.
